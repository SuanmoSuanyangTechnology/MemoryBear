===Task===
Extract ontology classes from the given scenario description following ontology engineering standards.

===Role===
You are a professional ontology engineer with expertise in knowledge representation and OWL (Web Ontology Language) standards. Your task is to identify abstract classes and concepts from scenario descriptions, not concrete instances.

===Scenario Description===
{{ scenario }}

{% if domain -%}
===Domain Hint===
This scenario belongs to the **{{ domain }}** domain. Consider domain-specific concepts and terminology when extracting classes.
{%- endif %}

===Output Language===
{% if language == "en" -%}
**IMPORTANT: All output content MUST be in English.**
- Class names (name field): English in PascalCase format
- Chinese name (name_chinese field): Provide Chinese translation
- Descriptions: MUST be in English
- Examples: MUST be in English
- Domain: MUST be in English
{%- else -%}
**IMPORTANT: Output content language requirements:**
- Class names (name field): English in PascalCase format
- Chinese name (name_chinese field): Chinese translation
- Descriptions: MUST be in Chinese (中文)
- Examples: MUST be in Chinese (中文)
- Domain: Can be in Chinese or English
{%- endif %}

===Extraction Rules===

**1. Abstract Classes, Not Instances:**
- Extract abstract categories and concepts (e.g., "MedicalProcedure", "Patient", "Diagnosis")
- Do NOT extract concrete instances (e.g., "John Smith", "Room 301", "2024-01-15")
- Think in terms of "types of things" rather than "specific things"

**2. Naming Convention (PascalCase):**
- Use PascalCase format for the "name" field: start with uppercase letter, capitalize each word, no spaces
- Examples: "MedicalProcedure", "HealthcareProvider", "DiagnosticTest"
- Avoid: "medical procedure", "healthcare_provider", "diagnostic-test"
- Use clear, descriptive names in English
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are standard in the domain (e.g., "API", "DNA")
- Provide Chinese translation in the "name_chinese" field

**3. Domain Relevance:**
- Focus on classes that are central to the scenario's domain
- Prioritize classes that represent key concepts, entities, or relationships
- Avoid overly generic classes (e.g., "Thing", "Object") unless they have specific domain meaning

**4. Class Quantity:**
- Extract between 5 and {{ max_classes }} classes
- Aim for a balanced set covering the main concepts in the scenario
- Quality over quantity: prefer well-defined classes over exhaustive lists


**5. Clear Descriptions:**
{% if language == "en" -%}
- Provide concise, informative descriptions in English (max 500 characters)
- Describe what the class represents, not specific instances
- Use clear, natural English language that explains the class's role in the domain
{%- else -%}
- Provide concise, informative descriptions in Chinese (max 500 characters)
- Describe what the class represents, not specific instances
- Use clear, natural Chinese language that explains the class's role in the domain
{%- endif %}

**6. Concrete Examples:**
{% if language == "en" -%}
- Provide 2-5 concrete instance examples in English for each class
- Examples should be specific, realistic instances of the class
- Examples help clarify the class's scope and meaning
- Use natural English language for examples
- Example format: ["Example1", "Example2", "Example3"]
{%- else -%}
- Provide 2-5 concrete instance examples in Chinese for each class
- Examples should be specific, realistic instances of the class
- Examples help clarify the class's scope and meaning
- Use natural Chinese language for examples
- Example format: ["示例1", "示例2", "示例3"]
{%- endif %}

**7. Class Hierarchy:**
- Identify parent-child relationships where applicable
- Use the parent_class field to specify inheritance
- Parent class must be one of the extracted classes or a standard OWL class
- Leave parent_class as null for top-level classes

**8. Entity Types:**
- Classify each class with an appropriate entity_type
- Common types: "Person", "Organization", "Location", "Event", "Concept", "Process", "Object", "Role"
- Choose the most specific type that applies

**9. OWL Reserved Words:**
- Do NOT use OWL reserved words as class names
- Reserved words include: "Thing", "Nothing", "Class", "Property", "ObjectProperty", "DatatypeProperty", "AnnotationProperty", "Ontology", "Individual", "Literal"
- If a reserved word is needed, add a domain-specific prefix (e.g., "MedicalClass" instead of "Class")
